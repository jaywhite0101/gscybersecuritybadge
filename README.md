Here's the code for the website we used in the Girl Scout Cybersecurity Basics badge! Feel free to look around and see how it was made. The comments in the files should help. Here's a link to the Github Pages, so you can go see the pages yourself: https://jaywhite0101.github.io/gscybersecuritybadge/login.html

Remember that the password is "thisisnotagoodpassword" and the security question answer is "Samoas".

Another useful resource to set up is Bitwarden [https://bitwarden.com/], which is a password manager. This makes it a lot easier to use long and unique passwords for every login, because it keeps track for you.  However, there are a lot of good password managers out there!
